## What is aim for ?

meta-erlang is a [Yocto Project/Openembedded layer](https://www.yoctoproject.org/software-overview/layers/) that enables developing [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org) and [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) applications on embedded Linux development context.

The target users are those that already know or desire to use YP/OE in order to build their software and application using Erlang/Elixir for embedded Linux projects.

You can build easily any Erlang and Elixir projects based on rebar2, rebar3, erlang.mk, mix and autotools.

## What can I do with meta-erlang ?

Some ideas:

- Build your own Yocto Project based Linux distro with Erlang/Elixir inside
- Create a hardware appliance product with Erlang/Elixir embedded software where you have the full control of all components
- Create a virtual appliance product with Erlang/Elixir embedded software on any Cloud service provider
- Enables the possibility to install and run BEAM based application on embedded Hardwares
- Fine tune configurations and options when building Linux distro for embedded or cloud usage
- Test and develop patches for Erlang and Elixir targeting Linux
- Create your own build dependency tarball with having Erlang and Elixir ready to use.
