In this guide we are using the plain meta-erlang layer to build the
[couchdb](https://couchdb.apache.org/.

The recipe
[couchdb.inc](https://github.com/meta-erlang/meta-erlang/blob/master/recipes-database/couchdb/couchdb.inc)
builds the couchdb using a crosscompile approach. couchdb prefers to work with a
full erlang release instead of use the Erlang packages installed on the final
image.

As a final result, we are able to run an embedded couchdb using qemu.

Follow the quickstart guide to get a basic working environment and then:

- Add erlang preferred version 22.x in _conf/local.conf_ (check the full list of
  Erlang supported versions here
  [Dependencies](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/install/unix.html#dependencies))

```bash
echo 'PREFERRED_VERSION_erlang = "22%"
```

- Add `couchdb` package to `IMAGE_INSTAL` in _conf/local.conf_

```bash
echo 'IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " couchdb"' >> conf/local.conf
```

- Now its time to build the image:

```bash
bitbake core-image-minimal
```

- And check the results with qemu:

```bash
runqemu core-image-minimal
```

couchdb needs two additional manual configurations in the config file
(_/opt/couchdb/etc/local.ini_).

- The first one is to enable the dashboard remote access. Find the session
  `chttpd` and change the bind_address. Like this:

```
[chttpd]
port = 5984
bind_address = 0.0.0.0
```

- The second one is necessary to add a administrator user to the couchdb
  instance. Like this:

```
[admins]
admin = mysecretpassword
```

Restart or start the couchdb service using the init scripts
(`/etc/init.d/couchdb restart` or `systemctl restart couchdb`).

couchdb has a nice dashboard where we can check the database and do all the
maintenance as well creating documents. Access the address
