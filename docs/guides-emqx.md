In this guide we are using the plain meta-erlang layer to build an
[mqtt](http://mqtt.org/) broker called [EMQ](https://www.emqx.io/).

The recipe
[emqx_git.bb](https://github.com/meta-erlang/meta-erlang/blob/master/recipes-connectivity/emqx/emqx_git.bb)
builds the emqx using a crosscompile approach both to erlang and C. As emqx has
a dependency called `bcrypt` which is a
[NIF](http://erlang.org/doc/tutorial/nif.html) driver. To address the
crosscompile, some
[patches](https://github.com/meta-erlang/meta-erlang/blob/master/recipes-connectivity/emqx/files)
were necessary.

As a final result, we are able to run an embedded emqx using qemu.

Follow the quickstart guide to get a basic working environment and then:

- Add erlang preferred version 22.x in _conf/local.conf_

```bash
echo 'PREFERRED_VERSION_erlang = "22.3.4.22"'
echo 'PREFERRED_VERSION_erlang-native = "22.3.4.22"'
echo 'PREFERRED_VERSION_nativesdk-erlang = "22.3.4.22"'
echo 'PREFERRED_VERSION_rebar3-native = "3.13.1"'
```

- Add `emqx` package to `IMAGE_INSTAL` in _conf/local.conf_

```bash
echo 'IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " emqx"' >> conf/local.conf
```

- Now its time to build the image:

```bash
bitbake core-image-minimal
```

- And check the results with qemu:

```bash
runqemu core-image-minimal
```

The follow screenshot shows a qemu session running emqx application:
`/usr/lib/emqx/bin/emqx console`:
