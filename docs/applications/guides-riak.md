# riak

In this guide we are using the plain meta-erlang layer to build the
[riak](http://www.riak.info). The recipe
[riak.inc](https://github.com/meta-erlang/meta-erlang/blob/master/recipes-database/riak/riak.inc)
builds the riak using a crosscompile approach.

As a final result, we will be able to run an embedded riak using qemu.

Follow the quickstart guide to get a basic working environment and then:

- Add erlang preferred version 22.x in _conf/local.conf_ (check the full list of
  Erlang supported versions here
  [Riak KV 3.0 Release Notes](https://github.com/basho/riak/blob/develop-3.0/RELEASE-NOTES.md#riak-kv-30-release-notes))

```bash
echo 'PREFERRED_VERSION_erlang = "22%" >> conf/local.conf
echo 'PREFERRED_VERSION_erlang-native = "22%" >> conf/local.conf
```

- Add rebar3-native preferred version 3.13 in _conf/local.conf_ file

```bash
echo 'PREFERRED_VERSION_rebar3-native = "3.13%" >> conf/local.conf
```

- Append `pam` to DISTRO*FEATURES in \_conf/local.conf* file:

```bash
echo 'DISTRO_FEATURES += " pam"'
```

- Add `riak` package to `IMAGE_INSTAL` in _conf/local.conf_

```bash
echo 'IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " riak"' >> conf/local.conf
```

- Now its time to build the image:

```bash
bitbake core-image-minimal
```

- And check the results with qemu:

```bash
runqemu core-image-minimal qemuparams="-m 1024"
```

The official
[riak documentation](https://docs.riak.com/riak/kv/2.2.3/index.html) has a
specific session about how to perform the initial configuration:
[Basic Riak KV Configuration](https://docs.riak.com/riak/kv/2.2.3/configuring/basic.1.html)
-- I recommend follow the instructions there.

After the first configuration it is time to start riak. As usual, use systemd or
systemv scripts (stop and restart as well) riak:

- `/etc/init.d/riak restart`, or
- `systemctl restart riak`

To make sure that everything is working properly, follow the guide
[Verifying a Riak KV Installation](https://docs.riak.com/riak/kv/2.2.3/setup/installing/verify/index.html).

Soon or later you will end up configuring a cluster. Then following this guide:
[Running a Cluster](https://docs.riak.com/riak/kv/2.2.3/using/running-a-cluster.1.html).
