title: Exploring x32 psABI for Erlang/OTP

According to [Wikipedia X32 ABI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X32_ABI) page:

> The x32 ABI is an application binary interface (ABI) and one of the interfaces
> of the Linux kernel. The x32 ABI provides 32-bit integers, long and pointers
> (ILP32) on Intel and AMD 64-bit hardware. The ABI allows programs to take
> advantage of the benefits of x86-64 instruction set (larger number of CPU
> registers, better floating-point performance, faster position-independent
> code, shared libraries, function parameters passed via registers, faster
> syscall instruction) while using 32-bit pointers and thus avoiding the
> overhead of 64-bit pointers.

So, I'm wondering if it would be possible to enable x32 support in Erlang/OTP
build. That way, I could make a Yocto image for x32 that runs on x86-64
machines.

Here is some references about the subject:

- [Yocto, Using x32 psABI](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/dev-manual/x32-psabi.html)
- [x32-abi](https://sites.google.com/site/x32abi/home?authuser=0)
- [X32 â€“ A Native 32bit ABI For X86-64](http://linuxplumbersconf.org/2011/ocw//system/presentations/531/original/x32-LPC-2011-0906.pptx)
- [Debian x32 port](https://wiki.debian.org/X32Port)
- [System V Application Binary Interface AMD64 Architecture Processor Supplement (With LP64 and ILP32 Programming Models](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hjl-tools/x86-psABI/x86-64-psABI-1.0.pdf)

In fact, x32 seems to be around since 2011/2012 and has been integrated in many
platforms. Like Ubuntu, Debian, Gentoo.

Enabling it for Yocto is simple, just adding the follow snippet in your
local.conf file:

```
MACHINE = "qemux86-64"
DEFAULTTUNE = "x86-64-x32"
baselib = "${@d.getVar('BASE_LIB:tune-' + (d.getVar('DEFAULTTUNE') or 'INVALID')) or 'lib'}"
```

Then, building erlang:

```
bitbake erlang
```

:::note

For those that want to check all configure and compiler flags, I'm including the
links to those logs:

- [Configure log output](log.do_configure)
- [Compile log output](log.do_compile)

:::

The build failed in one point related to ASM code in
[erts/lib_src/pthread/ethread.c](https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/maint-26/erts/lib_src/pthread/ethread.c#L193).
Looks like an ASM incompatibility issue. In order to address it here is
[a patch](https://github.com/joaohf/otp/commit/6cd15d5888a536af97f5d8e26b2db2e379fa7eab)
that just adds one more compiler check to pick up the correct ifdef branch.

Afer that, the build runs as expected. And testing it using QEMU shows exactly
what I had in mind:

```
runqemu core-image-minimal-qemux86-64.ext4 slirp nographic serialstdio
```

- check the current kernel

```
root@qemux86-64:~# uname -a
Linux qemux86-64 6.1.32-yocto-standard #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Mon Jun  5 13:43:33 UTC 2023 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

- check /proc/cpuinfo to see the 'lm' (long mode)

```
root@qemux86-64:~# grep -o -w 'lm' /proc/cpuinfo
lm
```

- check Erlang shell

```
Erlang/OTP 26 [erts-14.0.2] [source] [32-bit] [smp:4:4] [ds:4:4:10] [async-threads:1]

Eshell V14.0.2 (press Ctrl+G to abort, type help(). for help)
1> application:ensure_all_started(crypto).
{ok,[crypto]}
```

Well, looks like we are running Erlang/OTP 32-bits in a x86_64 machine. Also, it
was able to correct load the crypto (with ssl libraries compiled for x32 too).
By the way, there is a second
[patch need to proper compile the crypto application](https://github.com/joaohf/otp/commit/e63b5b703ffa0005bf6a8f4d3bcec18f786bda92).

Some raised questions for further investigations:

- What tests are necessary to prove that the x32 Erlang build is safe ?
- Are there any other code change in order to fit the x32 build ?
- Would [BeamAsm](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/beamasm#faq) be available
  for x32 ?
