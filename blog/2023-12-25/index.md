We've added support for the following new Erlang/OTP releases:

<!-- truncate -->

| meta-erlang branch | Erlang/OTP version          |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| dunfell            | 24.3.4.15                   |
| kirkstone          | 24.3.4.15, 25.3.2.8, 26.2.1 |
| master             | 25.3.2.8, 26.2.1            |

In additional to those new versions, now it's possible to read Erlang/OTP
documentation in Erlang shell. The docs .chunk files get generated during build
time and one could easily install it by adding the package _erlang-modules-dev_.
