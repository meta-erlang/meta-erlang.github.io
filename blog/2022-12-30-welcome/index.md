This new website is based on [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) documentation framework. The previous site
was using [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/), which is also great. But Docusaurus address others concerns when
writing documentation for open source project.

So, the site has a new frontend page and a blog session where we want to add latest meta-erlang release highlights.
The documentation session is pretty much the same plus some improvements on [Introduction](https://meta-erlang.github.io/docs/) chapter.
