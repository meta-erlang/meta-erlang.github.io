# Downloading and installing a pre-built beamtools tarball

In order to use beamtools, it is necessary to download and run a pre-built beamtools installer.
The following steps describe a full setup session:

:::note

meta-erlang provides recipes for more than one Erlang/Elxir releases. Each beamtools release
is made with the latest Erlang and Elixir versions. Check the [beamtools release page](/beamtools/releases) to get an
overview of the available versions.

:::

1. From the [beamtools release page](/beamtools/releases), locate and download the \*.sh

1. Execute the installation script. Here is an example for the usual
   installer:

   ```bash
   sh ~/Downloads/x86_64-beamtools-nativesdk-standalone-3.4.1-erlang-24.1.7-elixir-1.12.3.sh
   ```

   The installation script is going to ask the destination path. You are free to
   use whatever path you need.

   :::note

   During execution, a prompt appears that allows you to choose the installation
   directory. For example, you could choose the following:
   /home/your-username/beamtools

   :::

   The follow lines show the full output for beamtools installation process:

   ```bash
   joaohf@porco:~/$ sh ~/Downloads/x86_64-beamtools-nativesdk-standalone-3.4.1-erlang-24.1.7-elixir-1.12.3.sh
   BEAM tools installer version 3.4.1-erlang-24.1.7-elixir-1.12.3
   ==============================================================
   Enter target directory for SDK (default: /opt/beamtools/3.4.1-erlang-24.1.7-elixir-1.12.3): /home/joaohf/beamtools/3.4.1-erlang-24.1.7-elixir-1.12.3
   You are about to install the SDK to "/home/joaohf/beamtools/3.4.1-erlang-24.1.7-elixir-1.12.3". Proceed [Y/n]?
   Extracting SDK.....................................done
   Setting it up...done
   SDK has been successfully set up and is ready to be used.
   Each time you wish to use the SDK in a new shell session, you need to source the environment setup script e.g.
   $ . /home/joaohf/beamtools/3.4.1-erlang-24.1.7-elixir-1.12.3/environment-setup-x86_64-pokysdk-linux
   ```

1. Source the tools environment setup script by using a command like the
   following:

   ```bash
   source /home/your_username/beamtools/environment-setup-x86_64-pokysdk-linux
   ```

   After you have sourced the setup script configured the PATH environment variable and any
   other environment variables required to run the tools are initialized.

   The current shell has the environment variable configured to the correct Erlang and
   Elixir installation. And running: _erl_ or _iex_ gives you an Erlang and Elixir
   prompts.

   :::note

   For each new shell, it will be necessary to source the
   environment-setup-x86_64-pokysdk-linux file.
