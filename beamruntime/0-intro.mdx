# Introduction

beamruntime is also a tarball, self-installed and fuly relocated. Based on the same idea from [beamtools](/beamtools/intro). But targeting runtime execution and not for development.

A deep introspection for beamruntime is available at [beamruntime blog post](/blog/2025/09/25/index/)

It provides the following components:

- [Erlang](https://elixir-lang.org/)
  Some extra applications are possible to be enabled for Erlang/OTP but beamruntime disables them. So, with beamruntime there is *no* support for:
    * wx
    * SCTP sockets
    * odbc
- [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)

As said before beamruntime targets the execution of Erlang/Elixir applications without worry about having Erlang/Elixir installed on linux target distribution.
