## Running observer_cli

The example [Building observer_cli](/beamtools/examples/#building-observer_cli) was responsible for building observer_cli using beamtools.
Here we are going to execute it using beamruntime.

1. Use two shell and source the beamruntime for each one:

   ```bash
   source /home/your_username/beamruntime/environment-setup-x86_64-pokysdk-linux
   ```

1. In shell one, start an erlang node:

   ```bash
   erl -name foo@127.0.0.1 -setcookie mycookie
   ```

1. In shell two, run observer_cli and connect it to the _foo_ erlang node:

   ```bash
   _build/default/bin/observer_cli foo@127.0.0.1 mycookie 1000
   ```

1. It's done, you can play with observer_cli console interface and check stats from remote node.
